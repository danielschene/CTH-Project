Every Twente student and staff member  and many students from elsewhere  knows the Batavierenrace! But did you know that the finish of the 175 kilometer long relay race was on the other side of the country? In Rotterdam!  Inspiration for the Batavierenrace was the Sola Relay Race in 🇸🇪 Sweden. The race also featured runners from two Dutch cities: 🇳🇱 Nijmegen and Rotterdam. The participants liked it so much that they came up with a Dutch version: the Batavierenrace. The race was originally meant to follow the route that the Batavieren ran thousands of years back while they descended along the Rhine. This is where the name comes from. In 1973 the first edition of the Batavierenrace took place  from Nijmegen to Rotterdam. The race was 175 kilometres long  spread over 25 stages. However  the people of Nijmegen are dissatisfied with the finish in Rotterdam. It is badly organized and the traffic 🚗 🚋 is too busy to encourage the runners during the race. So they searched for a new partner. Both Enschede and Leiden are interested. Leiden has a lot of ambition and speaks in terms of top sport with a modern version of the Olympic idea. Enschede prefers to keep it a bit broader and accessible for everyone. Twenthe sobriety wins and a year later the finish takes place in Enschede. This set-up of the race proves to be a great success in the following years. The  Batavirus  is distributed at lightning speed. From 150 teams in 1974 the race grew to 200 teams in 1982. Faster growth is not possible because of the numerus fixus. Many potential participants have bad luck and are drawn by lot. From the largest relay race in Europe  the Batavierenrace grew into the largest relay race in the world 🌍.  A student 👩‍🎓 who has never participated in the Batavierenrace is actually not possible! A bad condition is no excuse  with routes of different lengths there is a route for everyone. And in the end it s all about fun. The fun of the night group to get lost in the dark with your van when you re looking for the next exchange. The fun to already enjoy the beer when your team mates in the bus are still waiting for their turn. The fun to turn the direction indicators and send the other runners in the wrong direction. And of course  the fun of the big  Batafeest  (party) on the campus with more than twice as many visitors as runners. The  Bata  🎽 is an event for everyone! From competitive endurance athletes who want to set the fastest time  to jolly students who participate in the race in connection with house mates  club mates  fellow students. In 1993  the mayor of Nijmegen  d Hondt  threw aside the starting pistol🔫 to be able to run. Even (former) rectors magnifici have been running for years. Former rector Van den Kroonenberg  a famous endurance runner  even ran more than ten times. Nowadays  the rectors at the finish line are welcomed with a glass of champagne 🥂. You have to do something to get them to run....  Returning to history: The prize for the winning team  a wooden Swedish horse 🐴  is a reminder of the SOLA relay. And Rotterdam or Enschede  historically it wasn t right anyway. In the days of the Batavians  the Rhine still flowed into the Zuiderzee. So the Batavians never actually were in Rotterdam.  Thanks to @AlumniUT for this piece of history!"	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/48411771_2273577492673631_436508302365425664_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=ad8a32ecc9a55b8034a81d0bb5611b92&oe=5CF3D13B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/49007487_2273577489340298_7713087696779870208_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=ef0232f9434812fef8aac4f3de67f00c&oe=5CEF6719	https://www.facebook.com/utwente/photos/a.153686597996075/2273577486006965/?type=3	facebook.com	2018-12-25T11:00:10+0000	1545735610	"2018-12-25 12:00:10"	16	0	18	0	18	2	0	0	0	0	0

Come and listen to the experiences of Ilse and Wytze: they both went to Mexico 🇲🇽 ️for their Minor.  👩‍💼 Ilse  who is a Health Sciences student:  The subjects I took in Mexico are considered as minor health sciences  but are mainly business subjects. And in my case  they also apply to my pre-master business administration.    👨‍💼 Wytze  Master (Industrial Engineering & Management)  loves beta courses  but wanted also to gain experience in the alpha department. That s why he opted for courses like Business & Media Management and Media Narrative Production & Design for his Minor. Wytze:  We wrote a strategic communication plan for a company. And with the other subjects  I learned all the ins and outs of producing films.   💡 Do you want to know how they experienced their adventures abroad? Visit the Let’s GO!

One of the perspectives which was rewarded with the Benelux Metrohm Young Chemist Award is the development of a biosensor. This biosensor can detect cancer at an early stage. Detecting cancer at an early stage contributes to higher survival rates with patients.   Dilu Mathew: “The biosensor is developed to detect circulating tumour DNAs. These circulating tumour DNAs serve as early stage cancer markers that are present in body fluids including urine. My work aims to detect cancer from the patient’s urine and therefore avoiding painful invasive tests.”"	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQC4Awk3PrV3iBzs&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.utwente.nl%2F.uc%2Fi63e5e2c40102c81e560015fcb101fe8f820b643f50f10701c3ee02000080%2Fdata.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQBqwq8Z8Sc-BxAk	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCmB-0S9zdR7G7C&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.utwente.nl%2F.uc%2Fi63e5e2c40102c81e560015fcb101fe8f820b643f50f10701c3ee02000080%2Fdata.jpg&_nc_hash=AQAticPeXkhDpbhf	https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/ne/news/!/2018/10/223012/nanoelectronics-group-member-dilu-mathew-won-the-2018-metrohm-young-chemist-award	utwente.nl	2018-10-18T15:00:09+0000	1539874809	"2018-10-18 17:00:09"	27	2	27	6	35	0	0	0	0	0	0

The symposium is prior to Jered Vroon’s defense on responsive social positioning behaviour for semi-autonomous telepresence robots (16:30-18:00).   There still is a lot we do not know about creating social (robot) behaviour. What do we need to create truly social behaviour? If we are creating artificial behaviour  how can we know which behaviours are ‘good’  ‘trustworthy’  ‘social’  or ‘appropriate’? How can we effectively imbue an artificial agent with this knowledge? How can we handle the practical and technical limitations involved? To focus these questions  in this mini-symposium we will focus on one specific angle; the role of ‘being embodied’. What are the opportunities and challenges of approaching the creation of social (robot) behaviour as an in-to-body experience? One of the lecturers is Prof.dr. Dirk Heylen (Socially Intelligent Computing @UT)   More information about the defense of Jered Vroon: https://www.utwente.nl/en/academic-ceremonies/phd-defences/calendar/!/2018/9/301775/phd-defence-jered-vroon #DigitalSociety"	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/42424732_2133943006637081_5916909541546524672_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=a864c03204b857625e737487a58e4162&oe=5CB3CB48	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/42430162_2133943009970414_1561948231095549952_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=97151fe2e5aeb78ee92d0d0aa0379cd4&oe=5CFCFB76	https://www.facebook.com/utwente/photos/a.153686597996075/2133943003303748/?type=3	facebook.com	2018-09-23T08:00:03+0000	1537689603	"2018-09-23 10:00:03"	13	0	13	0	13	0	0	0	0	0	0

Kant wordt wel gezien als de eerste Duitse idealist. Zijn Kritik der reinen Vernunft uit 1781  waarin hij de grondslagen en de grenzen van de menselijke kennis onderzoekt en een eigen epistemologie creëert  wordt als zijn belangrijkste werk beschouwd.  Vraag jij je wel eens af wat jij kunt weten? Hoe je moet handelen? Of wie wij zijn? Kom dan luisteren naar de lezing over deze filosoof gepresenteerd door Prof.dr.

Wist jij dat jouw waterverbruik impact heeft op het leven van iemand aan de andere kant van de wereld? Jouw water footprint is groter dan je zelf denkt en spreid zich uit over de hele aarde. Wellicht denk jij bij waterverbruik aan je watersparende douchekop  je energiezuinige wasmachine en het zuinig zijn bij het besproeien van je tuin. Maar er is meer  veel meer. De vorige voorbeelden zijn maar 1% van je totale waterverbruik! Wil jij meer weten over waarom je niet zoveel kleren moet weggooien? Waarom je minder vlees zou moeten eten om water te sparen? En ben jij benieuwd wat je water footprint te maken heeft bij het produceren van de koffie die jij elke dag zo hard nodig hebt?

Want to get rid of your Acrophobia in a  fun  way and for free? We are looking for you!   Researchers from the University of Twente have developed a succesful method to help people conquer their fear heights. This method is called 0Phobia (pronounce as ZeroPhobia) and can be followed using your own smartphone and cardboard Virtual Reality goggles. With 0Phobia you will conquer your fear of heights while standing safely on the ground.    We are in the process of making a promotional film for a crowdfunding campaign and we are looking for people who are afraid of heights and want to get over it.   So... are you up for a challenge?   On 5 September and 28 September we will go to the top level of the Horst (the balcony of room T1300) where you do some exercises using 0Phobia. You will be filmed while facing your fear of heights and we will do a short interview with you before and after the exercises.   Interested in participating in this video?

But will the computer of the future be able to do this too? Professor Wilfred van der Wiel is working on the development of a computer that works just like our human brain or is even smarter.   👨🔬Professor @wilfredvanderwiel:  We dream about fantastic applications  for example in the medical world. Such a chip with a neural effect might be able to take over part of the task from the brain in people with brain damage. Or for blind people  together with a video camera  they can give signals to the brain so that they can see again. It can be applied to all processes in which you now use your brain.

According to a theory dating all the way back to 1962  however  there is a regime of turbulence in which scaling gets more simple.

For several years now the Enschedese Midwinterhoorn Blazers spread their sound from the Alpha Tower through the city center of Enschede. This year  for the first time  from the top floor of the Horst Tower  they’re gonna try to spread their sound all over Campus!  A midwinter horn looks like an Alp horn and is traditionally made of wood. These days you can hear and see them in Twente  Veluwe  South East of Drenthe  Westerwolde (Groningen)  Eastern Salland  Achterhoek and in some places in Germany near the border with the Netherlands.

While we know the limitations of determining this index  we still tend to look at it before even reading one paper of the scientist involved. Even research funding has become highly personalized  nowadays. Isn’t it the time for a T-Index that values the team qualities and multidisciplinary approaches instead?  Both Rianne Letschert and Nieck Benes will address this topic on 2 November  on the occasion of Benes’ inaugural lecture as a Professor at the University of Twente. Rianne Letschert is Rector Magnificus of Maastricht University  Nieck Benes is Professor of Films in Fluids. Benes is also the new portfolio holder Education at UT’s Science and Technology Faculty.  In his inaugural lecture ‘Content  indeed…’ Nieck Benes will emphasize that teaching and education is the ‘raison d’être’ of a Professor and of the university as a whole. Apart from that  he will discuss new technology for creating thin films for membranes: his current scientific work. In the recently formed cluster of membrane research  teamwork is leading as well.

Zij is promovendus bij de vakgroep  Industrial Engineering & Business Information Systems (IEBIS-BMS))   Gréanne Leeftink ontwikkelde in haar onderzoek planningsoplossingen voor ziekenhuizen waar kankerpatiënten multidisciplinaire zorg nodig hebben. Doordat ze wiskundige technieken op een slimme manier toepaste in een zorgomgeving  zijn de verschillende processen in een ziekenhuis beter op elkaar afgestemd  waardoor de afdelingen meer patiënten sneller kunnen helpen. Niet alleen verminderen deze planningsoplossingen de wachttijd voor de patiënten  ook wordt de werkdruk van de zorgprofessionals beter verdeeld over de dag  waardoor ze meer tijd hebben om zich bezig te houden met het leveren van goede zorg.  Stemmen kan nog tot en met 31 oktober. Wil je meer weten over de andere genomineerden  hou dan FB in de gaten  want er zal in deze serie nog 1 post verschijnen.

ENGLISH:  Last but not least more information about our fifth nominee for VIVA400: Gréanne Leeftink. She is a PhD at the research group Industrial Engineering & Business Information Systems (IEBIS-BMS))                           In her research  Gréanne Leeftink developed planning solutions for hospitals with patients who need multidisciplinary care. Her clever use of mathematical techniques in a healthcare environment has improved coordination of administrative processes  allowing departments to help more patients in a shorter space of time. These solutions not only reduce waiting time for the patients  but also ensure that the workload for healthcare professionals is evenly distributed over the day  giving them more time to provide quality healthcare.   If she is the one who will get your vote  go to the website of Viva400 (this is a Dutch site) or our news website https://www.utwente.nl/en/news/!/2017/9/189484/five-university-of-twente-researchers-in-the-viva400 for more information about the other nominees.

De derde genomineerde is Valesca Retèl  posddoc binnen de onderzoeksgroep Health Technology & Services Research (BMS).  Dr. Valesca Retèl heeft samen met andere onderzoekers een subsidie van €1 5 miljoen verworven voor een omvangrijk en vooruitstrevend kankeronderzoek. Doel van het onderzoek is om nieuwe  veelbelovende geneesmiddelen als “therapie-op-maat” bij de juiste patiënten toe te passen en voor deze patiënten toegankelijk te maken. Dit wordt bereikt door het optimaal en structureel invoeren van DNA analyse van tumoren. Hiermee zou de hoogst mogelijke overleving en kwaliteit van leven kunnen worden behaald  met minder bijwerkingen voor de patiënt en minder dure behandelingen voor de maatschappij.

Dr Valesca Retèl  in cooperation with other researchers  obtained a €1.5 million grant for an extensive and pioneering cancer study. The aim of the research is to use new and promising treatments such as tailor-made therapies on patients who stand to benefit from them  and make the treatments more accessible. This can be achieved by both optimizing DNA analysis of tumours and by using a highly structured approach to entering this data into the hospital’s system  which is expected to lead to the highest possible survival rate for patients and improved quality of life  with fewer side effects for patients and a lower financial strain on society due to less expensive treatments.

Don t! Donate them to the foundation  Bouwstenen voor Gambia . Students in Gambia would love to use your old math books!  Mathematician Dick Meijer will spend the second semester of this academic year at the University of The Gambia  teaching courses Calculus  Probability Theory and Statistics. From former experience he knows that the students are eager to learn  but that materials such as textbooks in mathematics are not available or just too expensive for the majority of students. That is why he would like you to examine your book cases to see which books you do not use anymore: old editions of books on Calculus (e.g. Stewart and Thomas)  Probability Theory and Statistics  Linear Algebra and other common topics for science bachelor students are more than welcome in The Gambia.   So please tidy up your book case  so that Meijer can send them by container to The Gambia in October  in order to get them available in The Gambia when he starts teaching there by the end of January. You can drop the books at his office ZI 3035 (or in front of the door if he is not around) or ask him to collect them. (t.m.j.meijer@utwente.nl)  Deadline for your donation is 20 October!

Conventionele dijken volstaan niet altijd meer  maar het is wel mogelijk om een buffer te maken van begroeide gebieden zoals kwelders en moerassen  die de golven dempen. In het onderzoeksproject BE SAFE  uitgevoerd door onderzoekers van de Universiteit Twente (promovendus  ir. Pim Willemsen  Veni Dr. ir. Bas Borsje  Prof. dr. Suzanne Hulscher)  TU Delft en het mariene onderzoeksinstituut NIOZ  wordt momenteel onderzoek gedaan naar deze meer natuurlijke manieren van kustbescherming. Een grotere kwelder zorgt voor een grotere buffer  waardoor het achterland veiliger wordt. Zo kunnen extreme weersomstandigheden  waar bijvoorbeeld hoog water gepaard gaat met veel wind en hoge golven  beter opgevangen worden. Het behouden en begrijpen van de dynamiek van natuurlijk gevormde kwelders en moerasgebieden is dus van groot belang voor de kustbescherming. In Houston is juist gebouwd op laaggelegen moerasgebieden  zodat de buffercapaciteit sterk is afgenomen."	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAqe8IheUlSnvVz&w=130&h=130&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FzoCh8eBTuUk%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQAwdlbxcbDXxPQr	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQC_mpsC4t4JbZwQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FzoCh8eBTuUk%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&_nc_hash=AQCaE61_FiMhTwVb	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoCh8eBTuUk&feature=youtu.be	youtube.com	2017-09-04T13:00:15+0000	1504530015	"2017-09-04 15:00:15"	8	0	8	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

Students were asked to build their own Thales-inspired project using Arduino  and create a video to promote it. This gave them the opportunity to work with some cutting-edge technology.   Students of our university Rien Heuver (Computer Science)  Floor van Donkelaar (ATLAS)  Wybren Kortstra (Computer Science) and Egbert Dijkstra (Technical Computer Science) defeated all teams regionally and nationally so they are now in the running to participate in the international competition.
