He just completed his bachelor’s programme in Geography  Planning and Environment at Radboud University. He has a student debt  ‘just like everyone else’. His parents advised him to finish his studies  even though his career as a DJ really took off the last few years. One of his tracks has been streamed over 2 7 million times on Spotify. Under his alias DJ Rebourne  he performed for an audience of 15 000 people.  Does he feel different from other students? Not really: “The only difference was that my fellow students were often hung-over in class. That didn’t happen to me. I was busy making music and I had the idea that the more time I devoted to that  the more it would pay off.’  Read the interview Voxweb did with DJ Rebourne: https://www.voxweb.nl/international/summer-interview-end-dj-timon-van-merrienboer Of in het Nederlands: https://www.voxweb.nl/nieuws/zomerinterview-slot-dj-timon-merrienboer"	2017-09-06T13:24:19+0000	10159260287100335_10159260642435335	"Stef Arends Haha, leuk weetje."	2017-09-06T15:21:11+0000	1

We are given a lot of opportunities and we feel we should give something back.” Jafar Alhashime  member of the N.S.V. Carolus Magnus  explains why Carolus’ students are collaborating with the Nijmegen primary school De Aquamarijn to organise an artificial grass pitch and other fun activities for the pupils. Today  they even took 18 pupils on a picnic and a scavenger hunt.   “The underlying idea is that introducing children to students and familiarising them with higher education will make them more likely to see higher education as an option later in life.”  Whether that will be the case  we don t know yet.

Basically, Dutch people mingle amongst themselves due to getting into the same environment where interaction is already provided (classes, workshops, study/student committees/associations) so going into an environment where Dutch people will also be present and interaction is provided (but not the main goal) are great to mingle.  Problem here of course is language, but a way out would be to take a hobby you love and openly talk to people about it (almost everyone speaks English) and try to find environments where these hobbies are pursued. For example, I'm a dancer, so I could go to a dance class (even though it'd probably be in Dutch, you can learn enough from looking and doing). Or as a photographer, I could join a photography club or try to find a way to make my skill useful within my course (taking pictures of events and sharing them with a study association). Or as graphic designer I could make promotional material for student groups, and the list goes on. Basically, try to take something you like to do (that diminishes the language difficulties) and utilize that to come into an environment where interaction is present but not the priority. Use that low-key setting to chat to people (we Dutch may seem stand-off'ish, but talk to us and we'll tend to be as nice as you are yourself) and from there meet people with the same interests.  Once you know one Dutch person he/she'll introduce you to more groups and suddenly you're 'in'. Situations can change quite rapidly.  (if any of such people read this btw, you can also randomly message me and we'll see if we can work something out)"	2017-02-16T15:51:39+0000	5	native_templates	https://www.facebook.com/MeetandEat/

Although I have not learn to properly speak dutch, after a short time I could umderstand dutch by being accostumed to listening to my flatmates. In addition, they would teach me all about the dutch culture as well as many social rules which are not written or sometimes conscient to any local, allowing my flatmates to also think about their own culture and re-discover it while explaining it to me. (Can you tell I'm a psychology major? 😉 ) It was an absolute pleasure to do so and a mark in my experience living abroad that I am extremely proud and lucky to have had witnessed.
